# [Project 1: Credit Card Churn Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Credit_Card_Churn_Analytic)
Customer retention is cruicial in different businesses as aquiring new customers is often more costly than keeping existing customers. In this project, the aim is to predict if existing customers of a bank will leave its credit card services. Before this a customer leave, the bank can take proactive action so that the customers are continue the credit card service with the bank.

In this project a prediction model is developed to predict if a customer will churn based on their credit card account information and spending behaviour. It is important to identify if a customer will churn in advanced so that the bank can take necessary action (promotion) to retain the customer. Hence, accuracy (High True Positive and low False Positive values) and recall (High True Positive and Low False Negative values) are both important. With low recall value, high False Negative prediction, i.e, predicted a customer that will leave as a loyal customer, the conseqence can be very bad to the bank as higher cost is needed to acquire new customer than maintaining existing customer. 

**Business Question**: How likely is a customer will churn based on their spending and credit card account information?

* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* Perform data cleaning on the dataset 
* Construct a dashboard for reporting purpose 
* Develop a model to predict if an existing client will become churner, based on services signed up, account information and demographic information

**Business Question**: How likely is a customer will churn based on their subscription plan?

# [Project 3: HR Churn Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/HR_Churn_Analytic)
* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* A real world dataset
* Construct a dashboard for reporting purpose 
* Develop a model to predict if an existing employee will leave the company, based on department, working hours, number of project etc

**Business Question**: How likely is an employee will churn depending on their workload and experience in a company?

# [Project 4: Sales Prediction Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Sales_Prediction_Analytic)
This is a real world dataset provided during the Data Science 360 training. It is a dataset that recording the items sold (sales) based on the budget allocated for placing ads in google, facebook and instagram. Other than that, it also recording the areas and size of the market. Hence, in this project, the goal is to develop a prediction model to predict the sales of a new product based on given budget for ads, size and location of the market. 

* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* Develop a model to predict if the sales of a new product based on the budget allocated for google, facebook and instagram ads, and the location and size of the market

**Business Question**: What is the sales forecast after advertisement expenditure on different advertisement platforms?

# [Project 5: Chicago Crime Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Chicago_Crime_Analytic)
This is a dataset recording various crimes reported in Chicago from the years 2012 to early of 2017 which is avaiable at Kaggle. With this data, visualization can be done to visualize how the crime occurs accorss the years, identify which crime occurs the most, where is the location, how season affects the crime rate as well as the arrest statistic.

# [Project 6: Chicago Crime Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Chicago_Crime_Analytic)
This is the data set on the medical cost treatment of different patients. In this project, there is no medical history data. However, it consists information of age, region, bmi, gender, smoker or non smoker and charges which can be analysed and to develop a model to predict medical cost charges. <br>

**Business Question**: What is the predicted medical cost based on patient's habbit and demographic info?
