# [Project 1: Credit_Card_Churn_Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Credit_Card_Churn_Analytic)
Customer retention is cruicial in different businesses as aquiring new customers is often more costly than keeping existing customers. In this project, the aim is to predict if existing customers of a bank will leave its credit card services. Before this a customer leave, the bank can take proactive action so that the customers are continue the credit card service with the bank.

In this project a prediction model is developed to predict if a customer will churn based on customers' age, gender, tenure etc (refer to the following sections for more information). It is important to identify if a customer will churn in advanced so that the bank can take necessary action (promotion) to retain the customer.

# [Project 4: Sales Prediction Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Sales_Prediction_Analytic)
This is a real world dataset provided during the Data Science 360 training. It is a dataset that recording the items sold (sales) based on the budget allocated for placing ads in google, facebook and instagram. Other than that, it also recording the areas and size of the market. Hence, in this project, the goal is to develop a prediction model to predict the sales of a new product based on given budget for ads, size and location of the market. 

* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* Develop a model to predict if the sales of a new product based on the budget allocated for google, facebook and instagram ads, and the location and size of the market

# [Project 5: Chicago Crime Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Chicago_Crime_Analytic)
This is a dataset recording various crimes reported in Chicago from the years 2012 to early of 2017 which is avaiable at Kaggle. With this data, visualization can be done to visualize how the crime occurs accorss the years, identify which crime occurs the most, where is the location, how season affects the crime rate as well as the arrest statistic.
