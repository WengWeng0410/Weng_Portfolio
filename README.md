# [Project 1: Credit Card Churn Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Credit_Card_Churn_Analytic)
Customer retention is crucial in different businesses as acquiring new customers is often costlier than keeping existing customers. In this project, the aim is to predict if existing customers of a bank will leave its credit card services. Before this a customer leave, the bank can take proactive action so that the customers are continue the credit card service with the bank.

In this project a prediction model is developed to predict if a customer will churn based on their credit card account information and spending behaviour. It is important to identify if a customer will churn in advanced so that the bank can take necessary action (promotion etc) to retain the customer. Hence, accuracy (High True Positive and low False Positive values) and recall (High True Positive and Low False Negative values) are both important. With low recall value, high False Negative prediction, i.e., predicted a customer that will leave as a loyal customer, the consequence can be very bad to the bank as higher cost is needed to acquire new customer than maintaining existing customer. 

**Business Question**: How likely is a customer will churn based on their spending and credit card account information?

# [Project 2: House Price Prediction Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/House_Price_Prediction_Analytic)

In the housing market, comparative market analysis (CMA) is used to estimate value of a house with the aim of helping the sellers to set the house prices as well as buyers to make competitive offers. CMA is done by considering a number of features, such as location, years of the house, sq ft, view, grades and other features.

In this project, a machine learning model is developed to predict housing prices in King County, USA based on the properties' features such as sq ft, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, grades of the properties, view, etc.

Prior to the model development, EDA is carried out to understand and extract insights from the features. This is also to identify features that are valuable to include in the prediction model.

**Business Question**: What is the selling price of a house based on given a set of house' features?

# [Project 3: Telco Customer Churn Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/telco_churn_analytic)
* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* Perform data cleaning on the dataset 
* Construct a dashboard for reporting purpose 
* Develop a model to predict if an existing client will become churner, based on services signed up, account information and demographic information

**Business Question**: How likely is a customer will churn based on their subscription plan?

# [Project 4: HR Churn Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/HR_Churn_Analytic)

In this project, a model is built to predict if an employee of a company is at risk of leaving the company. It should be noted that it costly for a company to look suitable candidate to replace that employee, especially for the executives or high pay employees. This is due to the amount of time needed to conduct interview, training needed for the new employee as well as reduce of productivity for few months for the employee to get familiar with the new role. 

Hence, understanding why and when an employee is likely to leave can improve the employee retention as well as possibly in planning new hiring in advance. 

**Business Question**: How likely is an employee will churn depending on their workload and experience in a company?

Works done as follows:

* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* A real world dataset
* Construct a dashboard for reporting purpose 
* Develop a model to predict if an existing employee will leave the company, based on department, working hours, number of project etc

# [Project 5: Sales Prediction Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Sales_Prediction_Analytic)
This is a real world dataset provided during the Data Science 360 training. It is a dataset that recording the items sold (sales) based on the budget allocated for placing ads in google, facebook and instagram. Other than that, it also recording the areas and size of the market. Hence, in this project, the goal is to develop a prediction model to predict the sales of a new product based on given budget for ads, size and location of the market. 

* Perform data exploratory on the features in the data
* Develop a model to predict if the sales of a new product based on the budget allocated for google, facebook and instagram ads, and the location and size of the market

**Business Question**: What is the sales forecast after advertisement expenditure on different advertisement platforms?

# [Project 6: Chicago Crime Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/Chicago_Crime_Analytic)
This is a dataset recording various crimes reported in Chicago from the years 2012 to early of 2017 which is avaiable at Kaggle. With this data, visualization can be done to visualize how the crime occurs accorss the years, identify which crime occurs the most, where is the location, how season affects the crime rate as well as the arrest statistic.

# [Project 6: Medical Cost Prediction Analytic: Project Overview](https://github.com/WengWeng0410/MedicalCostPrediction)
This is the data set on the medical cost treatment of different patients. In this project, there is no medical history data. However, it consists information of age, region, bmi, gender, smoker or non smoker and charges which can be analysed and to develop a model to predict medical cost charges. <br>

**Business Question**: What is the predicted medical cost based on patient's habit and demographic info?
